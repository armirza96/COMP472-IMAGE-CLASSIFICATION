 How to run code:
  Step 1) Place project.py and MasksDataSet.py in same folder.
  Step 2) Download 'dataset' folder from this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JfwGuUhO3YKiRjq1Jf8GW5lfyKKueHS6/edit?fbclid=IwAR1aj5mcmn0DYRP9MoQItD4_FKagPo7tfhX1Yv3yXslmlgH7Oy-8dBmz520
  Step 3) Extract the dataset.zip file
  Step 4) Place 'dataset' folder as a child of the same parent folder of the python code.
          root -> {
			dataset
			project.py
			MasksDataSet.py
		  }
  Step 5) run 'python project.py' in anaconda
